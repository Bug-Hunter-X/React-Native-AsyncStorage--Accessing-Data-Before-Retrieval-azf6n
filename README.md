# React Native AsyncStorage: Accessing Data Before Retrieval

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications when working with AsyncStorage.  The issue arises from attempting to access data stored in AsyncStorage before the asynchronous retrieval operation has completed. This often leads to unexpected behavior and errors, such as `undefined is not an object` errors.

The `bug.js` file illustrates the problematic code. The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the corrected code with proper error handling and asynchronous operation management using `async/await`.

## Bug Description

When using `AsyncStorage.getItem`, the operation is asynchronous.  Attempting to immediately use the returned value before the promise resolves leads to the error. This is because the value is initially `undefined` before the asynchronous operation completes.

## Solution

The correct approach is to handle the asynchronous nature of `AsyncStorage.getItem` using `async/await` or promises.  The solution ensures that the data is retrieved successfully before attempting to access it, preventing the error and handling potential failures gracefully.
